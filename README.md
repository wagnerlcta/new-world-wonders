# New World Wonders
A very simple Android application to show the New World Wonders location and general information, according to the New7Wonders Foundation. The main objective of this repository is to create project management documentation according to PMBOKÂ® knowledge areas and process groups.

Currently I am a Project Management MBA student at FGV in Brazil, this project will help me to be a better Project Manager in the future, helping me gain experience in the area and improving my English. Feel free to clone this repository and use the documents or templates available in each folder.
